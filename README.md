- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ciaracristina
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. I used to be a teacher and I am loving learning all things tech. I also love pilates and going for long walks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and just finished Data and SQL. Both with Code First Girls.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me learn more and practice what I have been taught.
